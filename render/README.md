These are some high resolution renders produced by Lambda.

This is the ubiquitous Stanford Dragon using a frosted glass material, with a statue of Lucy in the background. The scene totals 625k polygons (100k triangles for the dragon, 525k for the angel) and took 9h21m to render with 1024 samples per pixel at 512x512 (unidirectional path tracing).

</p>
This is a demonstration of the frosted glass BTDF, with high resolution Lucy and Ajax statues. There were about 1.1 million triangles. This render has been amended once, if you saw the previous one, it was using the unfinished BTDF, this one is now physically correct (the difference is very subtle).
